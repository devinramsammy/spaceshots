PROJECT DEVELOPMENT LOG

May 20th, 2019
Devin initially committed the project.
There were still flaws in his design, so not much work went into the project on github, rather time was spent planning.

May 21st, 2019
Devin worked on the project in class and at home. There was a lot of progress on the initial ship, finding pictures for enemies and the ship. Devin worked on setting up the skeletons for all his classes.


May 22nd, 2019
Devin worked on the moving back and forth feature. He ended up coming up with an algorithm that redrew the ship after it left the sides. Also, Devin worked on the shot.

May 23rd, 2019
Devin worked on creating a new way to do keypressed and keyreleased. He setup a function in order to accomplish this. Also, Devin began to switch up his UML and change his plan.

May 24th, 2019
Devin worked on the enemy array. It was complicated to first instantiate it because he was using an array list and not a 2d array. Many bugs with the ships having correct spacing.

May 25th, 2019
Devin worked on the shooting more. Devin noticed that the shooting had bugs in it as if there were too many shots fired, there was a stack overflow error. Devin created an algorithm that only kept four shots in use at all times.

May 27th, 2019
Devin worked on the spacing of the ships. He used modulo and division to evenly space all the ships apart. Devin worked on the impact and the draw functions a bit more.

May 28th, 2019
Devin worked on the movement of the enemy ships. Devin initially got stuck with the movement, and created a formula which would shift it down as a certain bound is reached. It did not work as the position of enemy ships was different as ships were removed.

May 29th, 2019
Devin continued to work on the bug with the movement of the enemy ships and in the end, Devin just created an algorithm which included rectangles and tracked their movement. It worked and enemy ships moved around

May 30th, 2019
Devin worked on the enemy ships shot impact. In addition, Devin worked on the enemy ships shot. Also worked on ship shot cooldown so there wasnt intense lag and you cant spam shots.

June 3rd, 2019
Devin worked on the enemy ship and different screens. Devin implemented the boss ship. Devin worked on finding ways for the boss to shoot.

June 4th, 2019
Devin worked on the Boss shots and finalized the project. Devin worked on scores and lives. Devin worked on an impact system and a health bar system for the bus. Devin worked on creating an unlimited game that repeats.
